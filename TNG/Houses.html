    <h2>Houses</h2>
    <p>
      The School is divided into four houses after the names of the various mountain peaks in valley. Each boy is placed in one of the four houses. Each house is recognized by its totem which is a 'BIRD’ and each house has been assigned a ‘Colour’ which differentiates one from the other.
  The House System is devised to promote the qualities of leadership, responsibility, team spirit and positive self esteem in boys.
  Healthy inter house Competitions in various activities are held. The House System also provides an excellent way of meeting boys outsides one's class and age group, all of whom have a common goal and purpose.
  Each house is headed by a House Master. House Meetings are held at fortnightly intervals to discuss and plan the house related work.
